# ELK is writed with java but is it a trash too????

This question will be answered to each indivisual after learning this tool so no answer for me yet...

## What is it anyway?

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch) is a distributed, free and open search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. Elasticsearch is built on Apache Lucene and was first released in 2010 by Elasticsearch N.V. (now known as Elastic). Known for its simple REST APIs, distributed nature, speed, and scalability, Elasticsearch is the central component of the Elastic Stack, a set of free and open tools for data ingestion, enrichment, storage, analysis, and visualization. Commonly referred to as the ELK Stack (after Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), the Elastic Stack now includes a rich collection of lightweight shipping agents known as Beats for sending data to Elasticsearch.

## Where we use it?

The speed and scalability of Elasticsearch and its ability to index many types of content mean that it can be used for a number of use cases:

- Application search
- Website search
- Enterprise search
- Logging and log analytics:  for example,
how many views does your first post has on instagram? you can manage these
enormous data for hundereds of milions of instagram posts and hundereds of milions of
users using a super cluster of elasticsearch and some cashing...

- Infrastructure metrics and container monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Geospatial data analysis and visualization
- Security analytics
- Business analytics

## Note sample project 

Using elastisearch as its database, and fastapi as the gui.

## Counting views on every note problem

* Two approaches in sql and elk.
* Test simulation.
* Agents.
* Get views API.
* Who wins??
* Sharding is fraud?

## Ram usage... owwww...
